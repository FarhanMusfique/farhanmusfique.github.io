                <p>I'm a core team member of practice debates online, a platform found by a few high school and university students to do online debates for kids who live outside the megacity & can't partake in debates that much. Our goal is to provide them with a free online platform for practicing debates. We try to hold debates a few times a week and all you need to do to participate is send us a text and we'll add you to the messenger group. Our community also features regular free digital debate tournaments, frequent weekend practices and an assortment of training materials and live interactive workshops in an attempt to make debating as accessible as ever.</p>

                <p>It's basically an organization that works for the underprivileged people. A non-profit organization that is working for ensuring the basic rights of the unprivileged people. 
                    but the interesting fact that I love most about it is, it especially works for old home people, (for your kind information there is no govt old home in 3rd world countries same as in Bangladesh). so we try to stand beside them, bring a smile to their old & pallid face when they actually need the help most. Glad that I'm having a part with it also these old people contributed to our society, didn't they?
