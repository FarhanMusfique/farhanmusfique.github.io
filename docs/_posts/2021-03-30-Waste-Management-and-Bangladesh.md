Waste is a big problem all over the globe. It's one of the most getting issues, because our population is growing, and so are our cities. Even rich countries cannot sustain this rate of production. This means that these countries have also resorted to exporting waste to low-income countries.

In the USA, the bulk of the waste is 25%, while in China, the second is 21 percent. The report also mentions that five countries are responsible for producing two-thirds of the world's waste.As it turns out, a lot of it ends up somewhere. Every year, we make 2.2 billion tons of waste, and that doesn't include anything organic that we generate from activities like growing food or raising livestock. This number includes only waste products that are considered hazardous, including plastics, chemical sludge, and many others. It does not include water waste or food animals that are produced for food around the world. For example, the dairy industry alone produces more waste than you can imagine.
But exactly where does all the garbage end up? Well, trash ends up varies widely among geographical states. The most popular destination for solid waste is the landfill, by a wide margin. A landfill is a place allotted by regional administrates intending to dump the collected garbage. But this isn't the end of it.  

One of the most daunting issues in the world is the problem of mounting waste. Estimates show that global waste will increase rapidly to 3.4 billion tons from around 2.2 billion tons by 2050. More than half of the world's population is not equipped to manage waste properly so that they face the most dreadful challenge. Due to the defective waste management system, the oceans are contaminated. It is clogging the drains and causing floods. The consequences of poor waste management, causing respiratory infections, serve as a breeding ground for contagious disease vectors, and end up making use of global climate change through methane generation.

Bangladesh, as a third-world country, does not have the proper infrastructure for waste management and disposal. Dhaka, the country's capital, is the worst victim of this innocuous waste management system in Bangladesh. Every single day, Dhaka generates over five thousand metric tons of waste. Yet this city has only a 37% waste collection rate. According to UNFPA, Dhaka is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Back in 2011, Dhaka City Corporation was divided into two different parts by the Government of Bangladesh; thus, these city corporations can perfectly manage all their responsibilities. These two individual parts, named Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC), are responsible for collecting the garbage from their respective authorized area and dumping the piled garbage into landfills. Right now, there are two active landfills in Dhaka. The North (DNCC) disposes of solid waste at the Amin Bazar landfill site, while the other South (DSCC) disposes at the Matuail landfill site.

Amin Bazar landfill was built in 2007 and originally intended to be a sanitary landfill. A Sanitary landfill is a modern engineering landfill method where waste is isolated from the environment and allowed to decompose into biologically and chemically inert materials until it is safe. Amin Bazar is nothing more than an open dump now due to uncontrolled waste dumping, and its capacity was exhausted in 2017. On the other hand, Matuail landfill is the only fully functioning landfill and the oldest and largest landfill in Dhaka city. It is located approximately eight kilometers from Gulistan in the south of Dhaka. It has a rainwater drainage system. It is equipped with gas vent-pipes to prevent the buildup of methane gas.

Okay, readers, now you know where our garbage goes when we throw them away. But what happens when our waste ends up in one of the landfills? Well, it just stays there until it decays itself. Authorities put soil cover every day to speed up the decomposing process. But one big problem with an uncontrolled landfill like Amin Bazar landfill is they produce the toxic liquid called 'leachate,' which is trash juice. It is generally made with paints, pesticides, bleach, nail-polish, medicines, battery acids, fertilizers, and so on; Leachate is significant pain in the neck for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills, a momentous menace to surface water and groundwater. In order to prevent leachates from oozing out of landfills and contaminating soil resources, engineers have designed liners and leachate treatment systems. Still, the problem is that liners can be perforated. All of these are responsible for the contamination of 280 billion tons of groundwater each year. The measure set up by The Global Footprint Network shows that we are pushing the Earth 75 percent above what the planet can sustain in terms of resource extraction and garbage absorption. According to projections, if there is no significant change by 2050, global annual waste generation will increase by 70%. Mason Cooley said, "Human society sustains itself by transforming nature into garbage." We're cutting off the hands that feed us. The message to humans is clear: 'Deal with your garbage.' Otherwise, the future is going to be disastrous and deadly for us, because no one can escape reality. Can you do that?!! The answer to this is an absolute NO. So how to solve the problem of 2.2 billion tons of waste?

The right solution lies in technologies. Also, widespread social awareness is very essential to get success. It could diminish or even terminate the need for landfills and incinerators. But the attention should come from the inhabitants of the world first. We can shout and scream and throw a fit all day about what the government is supposed to do, but if we do not raise awareness among us, the situation will hardly get any better. 
You can choose products that have a longer life span and can be recycled & re-used. Instead of buying manufactured products, you can support eco-friendly manufacturers that don't use hazardous chemicals and avoid excess plastic packaging.
Currently, some trends are going on. For example, one of the modern lifestyles is living zero waste life. This concept has encouraged the emulation of sustainable natural cycles and the focus on waste prevention. You can recycle the garbage you throw away, you can prioritize the need for certain products, and you can buy only those you need most. The zero-waste lifestyle has already been adopted by many celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, etc. The leading green giant corporations like Google, Unilever, General Motors (GM) are now promoting it & becoming zero waste companies. General Motors make their engine cover insulation by using recycled water bottles from Flint, MI. At least 240 of Unilever's factories and 400 of its sites keep 100% of their non-hazardous waste out of landfills. We hope that we will be able to solve this big issue as soon as possible and make this world more friendly to all the inhabitants of this world.
